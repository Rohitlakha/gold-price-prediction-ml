## 🔮 Future Scope

- 🔁 **Real-time Price Forecasting**  
  Connect the model with live APIs to enable real-time prediction updates based on current gold price data.

- 🌍 **Integration with Macroeconomic Indicators**  
  Enhance model accuracy by incorporating features like interest rates, inflation, crude oil prices, and global market indices.

- 🖥️ **Deployment via Streamlit or Flask**  
  Build an interactive web application to allow users to input data and get instant predictions.

- 🧠 **Model Improvement with LSTM or Prophet**  
  Implement advanced time-series models like LSTM (for deep learning-based forecasting) or Facebook Prophet (for trend + seasonality decomposition).

## 📈 Project Output

Sample evaluation metrics from the trained model:

- ✅ **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** 12.5  
- ✅ **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** 16.3  
- ✅ **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination):** 0.89

📌 *These results reflect strong model performance, indicating good predictive capability on unseen data.*
